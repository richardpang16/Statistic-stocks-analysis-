The goal of this project was to analyze the correlation between Microsoft (MSFT), Tesla, and Apple stock prices with the SP500, helping investors make informed decisions based on risk and reward metrics. 

**Stock Price Evaluation**  
By comparing monthly price changes, we identified March and November as high-volatility months for all three stocks. During these periods, investors should either exercise caution or consider taking advantage of potential stock price discounts.

**Statistical Analysis**  
Microsoft and Apple closely follow the SP500, showing less fluctuation compared to Tesla. MSFT is the most stable and safest stock, while Tesla is riskier but offers greater potential returns.

**Regression Analysis**  
Microsoft has the strongest correlation with the SP500 (r = 0.968), making it the least volatile. Tesla has the lowest correlation (r = 0.942), indicating higher volatility and risk. Apple, with a high slope (13.76), demonstrates bigger impacts on the SP500, posing more risk than Microsoft but still closely tied to the market.

**Conclusion**  
Microsoft offers the most stability, followed by Apple, while Tesla is riskier but may yield higher rewards. Investors should be cautious during high-volatility months like March and November.
