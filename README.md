The goal of the project was to use statistical methods to determine which of three stocks—Microsoft (MSFT), Tesla, and Apple—had the closest correlation to the SP500. By analyzing these relationships, we identified key risk and reward metrics to help investors make smarter decisions.

Stock Price Evaluation
The first step involves evaluating the price movements of each stock by comparing their monthly price changes.
In the stock price evaluation section, we will examine the price movements and percentage changes of Microsoft, Apple, and Tesla stocks to identify the months with significant volatility.

Stock Price Evaluation : Outcome
The data indicates that the volatility of Microsoft, Tesla, and Apple is correlated with the SP500, particularly regarding price fluctuations.  
Significant volatility typically occurs in March and November.  
Based on these results, investors should consider a cautious approach during these months.  
Alternatively, investors may take advantage of potential stock price discounts during these periods.  

Statistical Analysis
Using Statistical analysis enables us to simplify and summarize complex data sets, making interpretation and conclusion drawing more straightforward.  
By utilizing statistical methods, we enhance our understanding of phenomena, which supports research and development across various fields.  
Furthermore, it offers evidence-based insights that guide strategic decision-making.  

Statistical Analysis : Outcome
Overall, all three are blue-chip stocks that are relatively safe investments, but Microsoft and Apple closely follow the SP500, showing less fluctuation compared to Tesla.
The results show that MSFT has the most similar price movements to the SP500 compared to Tesla and Apple.
Although Tesla is the riskiest stock to invest in, it offers a greater potential for higher returns compared to Microsoft and Apple. High risk often means high reward.

Regression Analysis
How changes in the SP500 (as the independent variable) affect the stock prices of MSFT, Tesla, and Apple (as dependent variables). 
We will show if there is a positive or negative correlation between the stock prices and the SP500.
By comparing the regression results for each stock, investors can assess which stock is more sensitive to market movements.

Regression Analysis : Outcome
Microsoft has the strongest correlation (r = 0.968), suggesting it's less risky and more stable like the SP500. 
Tesla has the lowest correlation (r = 0.942) and could be seen as more volatile.
Apple has a high slope (13.76), indicating bigger impacts on the SP500 but also more potential risk.

Conclusion
Microsoft:
Strongest correlation with the SP500 (r = 0.968), making it less volatile and a safer investment.
Closely follows the SP500 with minimal price fluctuations.
Tesla:
Lowest correlation (r = 0.942), indicating higher volatility and more risk.
Riskier, but with potential for higher returns.
Apple:
High slope (13.76), meaning its price movements have a bigger impact on the SP500.
Strong correlation (r = 0.953), but more potential risk compared to Microsoft due to larger price swings.
Overall:
All three stocks are relatively safe as blue-chip stocks.
Microsoft and Apple follow the SP500 more closely and are less risky than Tesla.
Significant volatility is noted in March and November; investors should be cautious or take advantage of potential price discounts during these periods.
Tesla presents the highest risk but also the potential for greater returns.
